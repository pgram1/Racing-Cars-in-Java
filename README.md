# Racing Cars in Java
A board game that was partially made in the first year of my BSc

GUI was not included as I was focused on the random board generation aspect

Here is an [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgram1/Racing-Cars-in-Java/master/presentation/sampleOutput.txt) of the map generator and gameplay.

Run via

```
cd bin/
java RacingCarsProgram
```
