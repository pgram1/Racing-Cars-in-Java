# Racing Cars in Java
A board game that was partially made in the first year of my BSc

GUI was not included as I was focused on the random board generation aspect

Here is an [example](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pgram1/d870a6385645bda5dcef913962cd5c0a/raw/ce19c9b3fe286a31b8697c7ad4f3cd3b3bf30bd5/gameplay) of the map generator and gameplay.

Run via

```
cd bin/
java RacingCarsProgram
```
